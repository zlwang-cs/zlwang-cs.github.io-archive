# About Me

Welcome. I am a Ph.D. student at [University of California](https://ucsd.edu), San Diego advised by [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io).

My research focuses on Natural Language Processing and Data Mining. I am interested in leveraging rich informaiton and releasing the potentials in the multi-modality and pre-trained language models.

Before joining UC San Diego, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn), where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io).
